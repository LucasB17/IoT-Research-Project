        Security Concerns
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    Security is possibly the largest concern with IoT technologies, when every part of your
    life is interconnected, a single compromised device can lead a nefarious actor through the
    network and onto every other device connected. There is also the aspect beyond a private home,
    where entire databases of consumer data collected from security cameras or other big data
    collections could be compromised and offer unprecedented access to people who should not have
    it. As stated by Shammar and Zahary (2020), “If cybersecurity is not well managed, the hackers
    will take advantage of the weaknesses and defects of IoT objects and then will distort data or
    disrupt systems through the global IoT network” (p. 41). Furthermore, simply the size of an IoT
    network can make it a daunting task to secure entirely, there will always be some kind of flaw
    that no one noticed before, so the focus falls from prevention to risk mitigation, where you are
    reacting to problems as they arise compared to proactively trying to completely seal the network.
    This may mitigate the scale of data breaches but limits the ability to prevent them altogether. The
    idea of cybersecurity regarding an IoT network is nebulous and complex and is something that
    has no concrete answers.
