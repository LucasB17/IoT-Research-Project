        Conclusion
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    IoT technology is only getting increasingly ubiquitous in everyday life and does not seem
    to be going away anytime soon. While there are benefits to be gained from the technology, the
    security and ethical concerns cannot be ignored. It is a fundamentally flawed system that has the
    potential to improve the daily life of every human on earth, but because of that expansive ability,
    makes it practically impossible to lock down securely, or regulate to ensure privacy. Research in
    the future can investigate new architectures and systems that may be able to alleviate one or both
    major risks, but as of right now, an IoT future is potentially one of overreaching corporate
    control.

Dellinger, A. J. (2023). Meta’s Smart Glasses Ignore Why Google Glass Failed: The mixed-
    reality wearable are stoking massive privacy, security, and ethical concerns. The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC.
*An overview of recent advancement of IoT technologies introduced by meta and apple, mixed
reality devices that are supposed to integrate the digital with the real world seamlessly, however
there are still numerous privacy, security, and ethical concerns. This source is useful for getting a
look at current IoT developments and tech. It also provides some angles to the ethical problems
with IoT devices.

Georgakopoulos, D., & Jayaraman, P. P. (2016). Internet of things: From internet scale sensing
    to smart services. Computing, 98(10), 1041–1058. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00607-016-0510-0
*This source provided a simple and understandable description of IoT as well as the current
scope of development. It also provided examples of usable IoT services and providers, giving
even more paths to research down. This source provides real world examples to draw ideas from
and make connections to. It is a versatile source that can fit many different headings in the paper.

*This source might be the best out of all of them in terms of giving a good view of the progress
of IoT. This paper provides a timeline of sorts to follow the development of IoT over time and
how it has changed through the years. It is also the newest, and because of its topic, it is the best
paper out of all the ones I found to giving a modern look at IoT and its applications in the current
world. Due to its size, it is hard to get a specific section to incorporate in the text and therefore
mainly used to get a personal understanding of the topic.

*a real-world example of data scraping done by google from their IoT devices and search engine,
shows the real-world threat of privacy concerns associated with IoT devices and technology. Has
some good quotes centered around privacy risks that makes it an easy source to pick from. Also,
it is new, so it contains up to date information about the topic.

    operating systems, and Trends. Library Hi Tech, 38(1), 5–66. https://doi.org/10.1108/lht-12-2018-0200
*This source varies from the first by being a much more technical overview of how IoT devices
work. It is also much more recent, providing a more up to date view of where IoT is today. It
also states security risks associated with IoT, which is important for the paper’s requirements. It
is a little old, but not egregiously so and highlights a solid understanding of the topic and
contains accurate predictions of the future of the tech, making it dependable.

*A focus on the security aspects of it all, useful to get the more security focused look at IoT
technologies, a little bit of privacy concerns as well. It is the oldest so I might not be able to use
its examples, but for general understanding I could use it. There are a few quotes that match up
to modern understanding as well, so one of those might work in the paper itself
