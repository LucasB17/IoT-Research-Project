        Potential Benefits
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    The benefits of an IoT network are mainly its ability to mesh every part of a system
    together for expanded interoperability and adaptability. For example, in a city where the traffic
    lights are connected to road traffic monitors can help to alleviate congestion by dynamically
    changing its timings or to allow first responders easier access to accidents by rerouting most of
    the traffic away from the incident. This idea can be expanded with smart vehicles that are able to
    route themselves and link with the other two devices to further maximize its capabilities and ease
    of use. But you do not need to go to the scale of a city to see the benefits of this technology.
    Imagine waking up and getting a readout of todays weather and headlines, then going to workout
    where you already have a program designed around your smart watch’s health readings. IoT
    technology is extremely scalable and versatile, due to its nature as a network of specialized
    devices, it can theoretically accomplish anything.

        Legal and Ethical Issues
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, IoT Technology is also associated with massive privacy concerns, where
        people do not want their every move to be collected and processed for some companies to
        optimize advertising. However, while there is also something to be said about the efficacy of
        these kinds of monitoring methods in police work, when criminals can no longer hide under fake
        names and appearances, the risk of data leaks or even just insufficient anonymization processes
        are far too great to be taken lightly, “Researchers once bought web browsing history data of
        German citizens and paired it with publicly available information to reveal the online habits of
        individuals.” (Dellinger, 2023). Companies are too relaxed with stripping the data collected of
        personally identifiable information, and too relaxed about who they are sharing this information
        with for it to make anyone feel safe about using IoT technology, which is one of the fundamental
        obstacles from getting a wider adoption of the tech. From an ethical standpoint, the endless data 
        harvesting is also a major detractor where the IoT begins to look less like a utopia, and more of a
        capitalist dystopia, “when Google bought Nest, a maker of connected thermostats, it has an
        opportunity to communicate with consumers through the devices, perhaps selling you ads for fire
        extinguishers if your house is on fire.” (Steeves, 2015).

        Social Problems
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        The main social problem to consider is the aforementioned privacy risk, when it comes to
        IoT, everyone is concerned about how this tech is any different from 24/7 surveillance. One of
        the current storms overtaking the tech industry is artificial intelligence, or AI, with seemingly 
        every company stumbling to make its own AI chatbot or integrate AI into their webpages
        somehow. AI fits nicely into IoT technology as, in a perfect world, would be able to control all
        the entire network far faster than a human could. But for an AI to function properly, it needs a lot
        of data, and companies like Google are already reaching around the user to collect its data, such
        as scanning the faces of people in your photos to find them through image recognition, or the
        many other ways they harvest personal information to deliver targeted advertising. (Herman,
        2024). Another angle is that not everyone wants technology to be any more an essential part of
        their lives compared to how it already is, and for many, IoT networks are the furthest thing from
        a bright future.
