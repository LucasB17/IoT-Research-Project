        Introduction
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    IoT Technology grew in popularity with the idea of the "smart home" where one would
    have a network of interconnected hardware devices from smartphones to security cameras to
    improve the overall experience of one’s life, this idea eventually expanded beyond the household
    and into “smart cities” and beyond. This paper will explore the idea of the "Internet of Things"
    and the current uses of the technology as well as potential questions for research in the future. It
    will also discuss concerns about security as well as the ethical and social implications of utilizing
    IoT technology in modern society to determine if IoT technology is a likely future that may be
    coming sooner than expected.

    <p>
    Most people already have experience with IoT technologies, Devices such as amazon's
    Alexa or Google's home are both examples of household IoT technology that functioned as
    "hubs" for an IoT network in your house. Things like digital clocks that can give you the weather
    or turn on your lights in the kitchen, and many more use cases. These same concepts can be
    expanded to work in many other cases, such as the aforementioned “smart city” where IoT
    technology can be used to improve the overall quality of life of large population centers. IoT
    technology is used in the military sector as well, streamlining and improving communication,
    logistics, and effectiveness. There are billions of these devices, such as cameras, sensors, RFIDs,
    smart phones, and other wearable technology that are all separately owned and deployed for their
    own purposes to intermix the daily lives of people with technology. (Georgakopoulos et al.
    2016).
